Alain St-Denis wrote the riloe plugin. Here is his description on how to use it:
"
This is basically what I do: I based the riloe.c on null.c and I just call the ribcl.py script. If there was a more generic shell plugin, it would be great. To use it, add something like: 

stonith_host host1 riloe "" 
stonith_host host2 riloe "" 

in ha.cf. Obviously, host[12] must be able to reach the riloe IP adress. All our riloe are named with a "-rm" appended to the host name.
