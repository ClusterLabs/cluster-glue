 * It is intended that the ST_CONF_FILE_SYNTAX info call return a string
 * describing the syntax of the configuration file that set_config_file() will
 * accept. This string can then be used as short help text in configuration
 * tools, etc.
 *
 * The ST_CONF_INFO_SYNTAX info call serves a similar purpose with respect to
 * the configuration string.
 *
 * The ST_DEVICEID info call is intended to return the type of the Stonith
 * device.  Note that it may return a different result once it has attempted
 * to talk to the device (like after a status() call).
 *
 * The ST_DEVICEDESCR info call is intended to return information identifying
 * the type of STONITH device supported by this STONITH object.  This is so
 * users can tell if they have this kind of device or not.
 *
 * The ST_DEVICEURL info call is intended to return the URL of a web site
 * related to the device in question.  This might be the manufacturer,
 * a pointer to the product line, or the individual product itself.
 *
 * A good way for a GUI to work which configures STONITH devices would be to
 * use the result of the stonith_types() call in a pulldown menu.
 *
 * Once the type is selected, create a Stonith object of the selected type.
 * One can then create a dialog box to create the configuration info for the
 * device using the text from the ST_CONF_INFO_SYNTAX info call to direct the
 * user in what information to supply in the conf_info string.
 *
 * Once the user has completed their selection, it can be tested for syntactic
 * validity with set_config_info().
 *
 * If it passes set_config_info(), it can be further validated using status()
 * which will then actually try and talk to the STONITH device.  If status()
 * returns S_OK, then communication with the device was successfully
 * established.
 *
 * Normally that would mean that logins, passwords, device names, and IP
 * addresses, etc. have been validated as required by the particular device.
 *
 * At this point, you can ask the device which machines it knows how to reset
 * using the hostlist() member function.
 *
 * When implementors of Stonith types put the return values of their
 * getinfo() calls inside the dgettext(ST_TEXTDOMAIN) macro, we should be
 * able to satisfy international customers as well.
